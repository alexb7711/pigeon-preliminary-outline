* Introduction
This document outlines and documents the conceptual and preliminary design considerations for {{{drone-name}}}. The
conceptual design is the early high-level process to establish over all needs and design goals. The preliminary design
is used to determine features of the basic components/subsystems.

The conceptual design is the first and most important phase of the system design and development process
\cite{Sadraey2012}. Typically, the appropriate starting point is to identify the problem and the associated definitions
of need at a conceptual level \cite{Sadraey2012}.

# TODO: Add description of preliminary design

* Conceptual Design
This section is divided into a few subsections to cover each conceptual design group independent of one another. An
early attempt of establishing a foundation describing the primary aircraft components, configuration, and classification
is made. By the end of this section the reader should have an understanding of what the objectives are for the aircraft,
its classification, and conceptual design features. It is also a primary objective to list other "standard" aircraft of
similar classification and configuration to assist in defining realistic baseline requirements.

** Design Goals
This section outlines the overall baseline requirements that the aircraft shall be constrained to. Research has been
done to get a general understanding of what the hobbyist's average system consists of. The chosen aircraft are of
similar configuration that the {{{drone-name}}} will have. This research is summarized in [[tab:plane-configurations]].

The goals that the {{{drone-name}}} aim to achieve \shall be to give a platform for basic avionics research to be
conducted on. Starting goals consist of having a basic remote controlled aircraft that has stable flight. Once this has
been achieved, the desired goal is to implement autonomous components, research, and further engineering on the
aircraft. However, before this can be achieved baseline requirements must be met.

The listed remote-control aircraft can be considered "introductory" as they are budget, lightweight, and do not have a
high flight weight (the maximum amount of weight the aircraft can sustain and still become airborne). An average weight
of a rc-plane can be range from 1134-1588 grams (2.5-3.5 pounds). From [[tab:plane-configurations]], a lot of these aircraft
come close to carrying double their own weight. Using these aircraft's materials and designs as inspiration should,
theoretically at least, allow similar numbers to be met. Therefore, the {{{drone-name}}} \shall have a weight of no more
than 11588 grams with a flying weight of 853 grams. The flight weight is the average of those in
[[tab:plane-configurations]]. The maximum weight of any component will most likely be the power supply. Preliminary research
of the largest battery used by the aircraft listed above is a 4500 mAh LiPo battery. These batteries have a weight of
about 662 grams. That leaves about 191 grams for the other components such as the on board computer, actuators,
microcontrollers, cameras, and other sensors.

Preliminary research shows that an average speed of these entry level model planes range from 64 to 97 kph (40 to 60
mph). Considering that this is a research focused aircraft, speed is not a pressing matter; however, it does correlate
to the maximum lift force which may need to be in the upper end of the distribution to be able to accommodate increasing
demands for weight as new components/sensors are added. As a starting point, the desired baseline speed \shall to be
above 64 kmh.

Flight time for an average rc-plane is 15-20 minutes. Considering more power will be utilized by the added electronics
for the sensors, on board computer, and microcontrollers, flight time may be impacted by this. Therefore, the flight
time of the {{{drone-name}}} \shall be no less than 10 minutes.

** Classification
The {{{drone-name}}} is to be a hybrid radio-controlled/autonomous aircraft system. It has no intent of modeling after
any other real life aircraft, otherwise known as being a flying model. The radio-controlled system, as any other typical
remote controlled aircraft, has a transmitter with the pilot operating it from the ground. The radio-controlled portion
will be designed first along with the aircraft to ensure that the system is capable of stable flight.

Once this has been achieved, the autonomous dual to the system will begin to be introduced in phases. These phases,
subject to change, include take off, landing, collision avoidance, way point following, etc. These phases, however, do
not account for internal engineering efforts such as software design, control design, filtering, etc. These concepts
will be flushed out in more detail at a later date.

** Primary Aircraft Components and Configuration
The basic components of the aircraft are: wing, fuselage, horizontal tail, vertical tail, engine, and landing gear.
These components are essential in describing the plane. A high level configuration for each is to be described. The
terminology convention follows \cite{Sadraey2012}. The wing configuration \shall be a mono-plane, high wing, rectangular,
and fixed wing. The tail configuration \shall be an aft tail, conventional, and fixed. The propulsion system \shall be a
single-engine placed in front of nose, tractor, and propeller driven. The landing gear configuration \shall be a fixed
tail gear. The fuselage configuration \shall be an unpressurized cabin where the electronic components will seat. The
aircraft \shall be built of Expanded polypropylene (EPP) is an extremely resilient variety of foam, often used in basic
trainers, which take considerable abuse from beginners, PLA plastic, and carbon fiber rods. The subsystem configuration
\shall have a conventional primary control surfaces, fly-by-wire power transmission, battery will be inside the
fuselage, and the aircraft \shall store cameras, sensors, and other electronics on board.

* Preliminary Design
** Weight Buildup
The total weight is composed of different components of the aircraft.

#+begin_export latex
\begin{equation}
  W_{TO} = W_{PL} + W_A + W_B + W_E
\end{equation}
#+end_export

Which are the total weight, payload weight, battery weight, and the empty weight. This can be rearranged into

#+begin_export latex
\begin{equation}
  W_{TO} = \frac{W_{PL} + W_A}{1 - \frac{W_B}{W_{TO}} - \frac{W_E}{W_{TO}}}
\end{equation}
#+end_export

*** Payload weight
Payload weight of the UAV is the net carrying capacity of the aircraft. This includes cameras sensors, camera, radar,
etc. These values are determined by the specification sheet as well as a safety factor $Sf=1.5$.

#+begin_src octave
  Sf      = 1.5;                                   # Safety factor
  w_cam   = 50;                                    # Camera weight
  w_lidar = 50;                                    # Lidar weight

  W_pl    = Sf*(w_cam + w_lidar);                  # Payload weight

  disp(W_pl);                                      # Display the payload weight
#+end_src

*** Autopilot weight
This is the weight that contributes to the flight operations of the aircraft. In the instance of the {{{drone-name}}},
it consists of both radio systems and autopilot. The mass of the inertial measurement unit (IMU) devices are very small
relative to the other autopilot pieces. These include sensors such as altimeter, GPS, gyroscope/accelerometer.

#+begin_src octave
  w_pc  = 46;                                      # Onboard PC weight
  w_mc  = 25;                                      # Microcontroller weight
  w_rad = 27.22;                                   # Radio reciever weight
  w_imu = 50;                                      # IMU weights

  W_a   = Sf*(w_pc + w_mc + w_rad + w_imu);        # Autopilot weight

  disp(W_a);                                       # Display autopilot weight
#+end_src

#+RESULTS[a80eb0f06022fde0a410cfc44c6db547964f19f8]:
:
: octave> octave> octave> octave> octave> octave> 222.33

*** Battery Weight
The {{{drone-name}}} is a battery-driven aircraft. The battery weight is a major contributor to the weight buildup of
the aircraft. \cite{Sadraey2012} shows that for a propeller-driven aircraft, its battery weight ratio can be written as
show in [[eq:battery-weight-ratio]]. $g$ is the gravity constant, $\eta_P$ is the propeller efficiency, $E_D$ energy density
of the battery, $R$ is the desired range, $C_L$ is the cruise lift coefficient, and $C_D$ is the drag due to the
aircraft configuration.

#+name: eq:battery-weight-ratio
#+begin_export latex
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:battery-weight-ratio}
  W_B = 1.05 \Big( \frac{g}{\eta_P E_D} \frac{R}{C_L / C_D} \Big)
\end{equation}
#+end_export

The propeller efficiency has typical values ranging from 0.6 through 0.8. For the sake of adding safety factors in the
design, the low end of the efficiency shall be used. The range can be determined from [[eq:cruise-time]]. $V_C$ denotes the
cruising velocity. Average starter RC aircraft velocities rage from 64 to 97 kph. Solving for $R$ is simple, and we have
defined the flight time to be about 10 minutes. The output of [[octave:range]] calculates the estimated range.

#+name: eq:cruise-time
#+begin_export latex
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:cruise-time}
  t_C = \frac{R}{V_C}
\end{equation}
#+end_export

#+name: octave:range
#+begin_src octave
  R = (10) * (64 * (1000/60));                     # min * m/min

  disp(R);
#+end_src
